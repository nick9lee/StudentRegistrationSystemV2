# StudentRegistrationSystemV2

emmulates student registration system

built with Ahmed Amer(ahmedamer2) and Mustafa Muhammad(MustafaMuhammad2000)

Oct 16 2020 Note: At the time of building this project I didn't realize that people might want to run this on their personal machine, 
So I will need to relearn a bit on how to export a MySQL data base to github. I will try to figure it out after I complete my midterms, 
and will definietly have something that people can run on their own machines before christmas. Sorry for the inconvienience.

In the meantime if you are interested in seeing the program in action please see my video documenting its features
